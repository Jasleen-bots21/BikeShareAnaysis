# BikeShareAnaysis
Focusing on forenamed quotes, many cities are leveraging new mobility strategies by taking “Smart City Initiative” to meet the increasing mobility demand. A bike-sharing system offers a self-service, short-term and one-way urban bike rental in public spaces to several groups. Nowadays, it is a growing global trend which plays a niche role in maintaining the cost and sustainable transport systems. However, a recurring challenge is how one can derive insights from the data being collected. 
### Primary Objective
To build a superior statistical model to predict the number of bicycles that can be rented.  To see the relationship between Temperature, Snow, rainfall and number of trips.
### Secondary Objective
To have a better understanding of how real-time data is represented in datasets.  To learn how to prepare this data for analysis.  To investigate the results of various statistical modelling approaches in terms of comparison.
